# PowerShell `ls -R` Issue in Web Projects

## Findings

In this project, running `ls -R` (which is an alias for `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` in PowerShell) often results in the process hanging or terminating with **exit code 1**.

### Why it fails

1.  **`node_modules` Complexity**: Modern web projects contain thousands of files and deeply nested folders within the `node_modules` directory. Recursive traversal is extremely resource-intensive.
2.  **Windows Path Limits**: Windows has a default 260-character path length limit (`MAX_PATH`). Many nested packages in `node_modules` exceed this limit. When `Get-ChildItem` encounters these paths, it can throw fatal errors or fail to process them correctly, leading to exit code 1.
3.  **Terminal Buffer Overload**: The sheer volume of output generated by listing every file in `node_modules` can overwhelm the terminal and cause it to hang.

### Recommendations

To safely explore the project without these issues:

*   **List root files only**: Use `ls` without the `-R` flag.
*   **Target specific folders**: Use `ls src` or `ls public` to see the actual application code.
*   **Search with exclusions**: If searching for text, use tools that can exclude `node_modules` (e.g., `grep` or `Select-String` with filtering).
